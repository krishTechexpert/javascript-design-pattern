  <h1>Factory design pattern:</h1>
  <h2>
    The Factory Design Pattern is especially useful in UI development for creating complex, configurable, and reusable components. Here’s a simple example of using the Factory Pattern to build different types of UI components in JavaScript.
  </h2>
  <ul>
  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <li>Encapsulation: <p>The client code doesn’t need to know the specification of each button type.</p>

<p>"the client code" refers to the part of your application that uses the ButtonFactory to create buttons and work with them. Essentially, the client code is any code that interacts with the factory, asking it to create instances without needing to know the specific details of each button type.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Flexibility: New button types can be added by creating new classes and updating the factory method.</li>
  <li>Reusability: The factory makes it easy to create buttons consistently throughout the application.</li>
  <li><b>Why Is This Important?</b><br>
    The Factory Pattern’s goal is to abstract the instantiation logic so that the client code only interacts with a simple interface (ButtonFactory.createButton). This approach makes the client code more flexible because it doesn’t need to change if you add new button types (like a WarningButton) or modify existing ones.</li>
This pattern makes UI components modular and scalable,maintainability, which is ideal for larger applications.
